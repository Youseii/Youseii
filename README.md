# Welcome on my profile!

My name is Christian Chaux and I'm currently a 5th year student at the french school of EPITECH
But I also really like working on some personal projects on my free time (you can see them if you scroll down a bit)
Aside from programming, I also enjoy playing some video games or reading books
If you want more info about me, feel free to visit my website

# Need help using one of my project?
Feel free to open issues on the GitHub page of my projects if you need anything

If you want a more direct way, you can also either contact me by mail (at xwilarg@yahoo.fr) or on Discord (either by adding Zirk#0001 or by coming to my support server)

# Want to add a new feature?
If you want to add a new feature to one of my projects feel free to open a pull request on any of them!

# Want to support me?
The easiest way you can do that is to leave a star on the project!

If you want to do more, you can leave a comment on the website where the project is distributed or support me using GitHub sponsor
